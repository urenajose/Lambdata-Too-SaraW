I ran the ds_utilities.py trought return following:

Code	Line	Column	Text
E302	7	1	expected 2 blank lines, found 1
E501	12	80	line too long (80 > 79 characters)
E501	31	80	line too long (87 > 79 characters)
E501	45	80	line too long (80 > 79 characters)
E501	61	80	line too long (86 > 79 characters)
E501	63	80	line too long (92 > 79 characters)
E501	64	80	line too long (96 > 79 characters)
E128	65	26	continuation line under-indented for visual indent
E231	86	20	missing whitespace after ','
E231	90	12	missing whitespace after ','
E231	94	14	missing whitespace after ','
E231	97	13	missing whitespace after ','
W293	98	1	blank line contains whitespace
W391	98	1	blank line at end of file

I did not know how to use my_string, I guess is above my technical skill and understanding.
